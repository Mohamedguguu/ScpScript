Hey everyone, welcome to the SCP Script.

What does it do?
It completely breaks SCP â€” permanently.
Why did I do it? Just wanted to be the first to pull it off.

Controls:

K = Break SCP

L = Toggle ESP

X = Toggle X-Ray

If you're the game owner and want this taken down, DM msbncdaynight2

The script only works at
https://www.roblox.com/games/134804564161823/NEW-SCP-096-Demonstration#!/game-instances

to use 
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mohamedguguu/ScpScript/main/MainCode"))() 

My dms are opened
