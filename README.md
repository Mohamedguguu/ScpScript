Hey everyone, welcome to the SCP Script.

What does it do?
It completely breaks SCP â€” permanently.
Why did I do it? Just wanted to be the first to pull it off.
--------------------SCPBREAKER
Controls:

K = Break SCP

L = Toggle ESP

X = Unload
----------------------CONTROL096
K = Control scp but enable it before he starts screaming and running
x = Unload
L = speed bypass
----------------------
If you're the game owner and want this taken down again, DM msbncdaynight2

The script only works at
